## Git Workflow

**Two separate permission gates — always ask before each step:**
1. Make changes locally, then ask: "Would you like me to commit?"
2. After committing, ask: "Would you like me to push to GitHub?"

Never assume permission from prior context. Explicit confirmation required for every commit and every push, in all repositories.

## Strategic Analysis Framework
Before implementing non-trivial tasks, pause to analyze:
- **Clarify intent**: What problem is the user *really* trying to solve? Challenge assumptions.
- **Assess impact**: How will this affect other parts of the system? What dependencies are involved?
- **Propose options**: Offer a simple/safe approach, a recommended approach, and alternatives when appropriate.
- **State trade-offs**: Explicitly call out complexity vs. maintainability, security vs. usability, etc.
- **Anticipate failures**: Identify likely failure modes and known anti-patterns.

## Large-Scale Analysis
For tasks spanning many files or exceeding context capacity, use subagents or tool-based search rather than reading files individually. Scope searches precisely and use relative paths.
