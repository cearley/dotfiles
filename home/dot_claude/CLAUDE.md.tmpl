### CRITICAL: Git Commit and Push Protocol

**NEVER make git commits without explicit user consent**
- Make code changes locally
- STOP and ask user: "Would you like me to commit these changes?"
- Wait for explicit confirmation (e.g., "yes", "go ahead and commit")
- Only then execute `git commit`

**NEVER push to GitHub without explicit user consent**
- After committing (with permission), STOP again
- Ask user: "Would you like me to push this to GitHub?"
- Wait for explicit confirmation (e.g., "yes, push it", "go ahead")
- Only then execute `git push`

### Correct Workflow Example

1. Make code changes locally
2. Ask: "Would you like me to commit these changes?"
3. User responds: "yes"
4. Execute git commit
5. Ask: "The changes have been committed locally. Would you like me to push to GitHub?"
6. User responds: "yes, push it"
7. Execute git push

### Key Principles

- Two separate permission gates: one for commit, one for push
- Never assume permission from context
- Always explicit confirmation required
- Applies to ALL projects and repositories

## Strategic Analysis Framework
Before implementing non-trivial tasks, pause to analyze:
- **Clarify intent**: What problem is the user *really* trying to solve? Challenge assumptions.
- **Assess impact**: How will this affect other parts of the system? What dependencies are involved?
- **Propose options**: Offer a simple/safe approach, a recommended approach, and alternatives when appropriate.
- **State trade-offs**: Explicitly call out complexity vs. maintainability, security vs. usability, etc.
- **Anticipate failures**: Identify likely failure modes and known anti-patterns.

## Large-Scale Analysis
For tasks spanning many files or exceeding context capacity, use subagents or tool-based search rather than reading files individually. Scope searches precisely and use relative paths.
