Always use:
- aws-knowledge-mcp-server to access AWS knowledge, such as its docs, API references, architectural references, and well-architected guidance
- basic-memory to remember and recall previous conversations
- gemini-cli for large codebase analysis and multi-file comparisons
- sequential thinking for any decision making
- serena for semantic code retrieval and editing tools, and always update its symbols before using it and after any code changes
