# Machine-specific configuration
# Maps machine name patterns to their corresponding machine settings
#
# The machine name is obtained from the `machine-name` template, which returns:
#   - macOS:   Output of `scutil --get "ComputerName"`
#   - Linux:   Static hostname from hostnamectl
#   - Windows: System hostname from DNS
#
# Patterns are matched using substring matching (contains), so:
#   "MacBook Pro" matches "MacBook Pro", "HAL 9000's MacBook Pro", "Work MacBook Pro", etc.
#   "Mac mini" matches "Mac mini", "NotTheITDept Mac mini", "Office Mac mini", etc.
#
# If no pattern matches, templates return empty strings and scripts will skip
# machine-specific operations gracefully.
#
# Explanation of machine-specific properties:
#
# brewfile         - Specifies the Homebrew Brewfile to use for that machine.
#                    These are located in the brewfiles/ directory within the
#                    chezmoi source directory and the machine's brewfile is
#                    symlinked to $HOME/Brewfile during setup.
#
# keepassxc_entries - Machine-specific KeePassXC entry mappings.
#                     Maps logical names (e.g., "ssh") to actual KeePassXC
#                     entry names. (This is useful when different machines
#                     share the same keepassxc database but have different
#                     entries for the same purpose.)
